# Spelling_Correction
Spelling correction is an essential component in applications like text editors, search engines, chatbots, and natural language processing (NLP) systems. In Python, we can leverage various libraries and algorithms to efficiently handle spelling corrections.

There are various ways to perform Spelling correction:
Levenshtein Distance: Measures the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to change one word into another. Itâ€™s widely used in spell check algorithms.

N-Grams: Divides text into contiguous sequences of n items (e.g., characters or words). It helps to find similar patterns for correcting typos.

Corpus-based Models: Uses a predefined dictionary or corpus to check for valid words and find the closest match for misspelled words.
